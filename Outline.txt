def solve(pos):

	if pos matches end:
		Done
	
	paths = get_paths(pos)
	
	remove previous paths

	if numpaths == 1:
		move to spot
		adjust pos and previous
		
	elif 2 or 3

		for i in possibilities:
			pos = i
			previous = fork
			solve(pos)




keep track of each:
-fork pos []
-possible paths []
-previous pos at fork []
